Python task L1->L2 process

#Task1

This script first opens the JSON file and loads the data into a Python dictionary. 
It defines a recursive function called _validate_json(). 
This function takes a JSON data object and a list of keys as input and validates if all values for all keys in the JSON data object are not in blank. 
If a key has an empty value, the key is added to the empty_keys list.

The main function then defines a JSON data file and calls the validate_json() function on it. 
The validate_json() function prints the list of keys with empty values.

To run this code, you need to first create a JSON file and save it in the same directory as the script. 
Then, you can run the script by passing the path to the JSON file as an argument. 
For example, to run the script on the JSON file my_json_file.json, you would run the following command:

python validate_json.py my_json_file.json

If there are any keys in the JSON file with empty values, the script will print the list of keys. 
Otherwise, the script will print a message saying that all values for keys inside the JSON file are not in blank.

#Task2

This script first defines a function called rotate_log_files(). 
This function takes a directory as input and rotates all log files in the directory that have surpassed the 10MB size. 
The function works by first checking if the file is a file and its size is greater than 10MB. 
If the file meets these conditions, the function then creates a new file with the original name and renames the original file by appending 
the current date and time.

The main function then defines the directory where the log files are located and calls the rotate_log_files() function on it.

For testing upload the +10Mb file to the shell /home/ochoamendoza or /var/logs and then run the script

To run this code, you need to first create a directory where the log files are located. 
Then, you can save the script as a Python file and run it by passing the path to the directory as an argument. 
For example, to run the script on the directory /var/log, you would run the following command:

python rotate_log_files.py /var/log

This will rotate all log files in the directory /var/log that have surpassed the 10MB size.
